# JetBrains Material Theme
This is a [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) port of both the UI and UX for JetBrains products.

**Installation**    
* Download [Material Theme.jar](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains/raw/master/Material%20Theme.jar)    
* Open `Preferences` -> `Plugins` - > `Install plugin from disk...` and choose the jar.

That's it!

**NOTE:** This initial beta only has the default material colour scheme. The `darker` and `lighter` scheme's will be added asap.

**PhpStorm only (Support for most of the JetBrains apps will be added)**. Tested on OS X and Windows 10.
