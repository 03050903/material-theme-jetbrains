# JetBrains Material Theme
This is a [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) port of both the UI and UX for JetBrains products.

#### Requirements
* PhpStorm 9.0.2, build 141.2462 with JDK 1.8 ([Download](http://download.jetbrains.com/webide/PhpStorm-9.0.2-custom-jdk-bundled.dmg))

#### Installation
* Download [Material Theme.jar](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains/raw/master/Material%20Theme.jar)    
* Open `Preferences` -> `Plugins` - > `Install plugin from disk...` and choose the jar.

**NOTE:** This initial beta only has the default material colour scheme. The `darker` and `lighter` scheme's will be added asap.

**PhpStorm only (Support for most of the JetBrains apps will be added)**. Tested on OS X and Windows 10.

#### TODO
* Add support for more JetBrains apps.
* Add more icons.
* Dynamically change the UI colors according to the active color scheme.
* Add `lighter` and `darker` colour schemes.
* Add support for EAP releases.
* Check to see if we can add support for earlier JDK versions.
* As I personally prefer the [Facebook Scheme](https://github.com/mbixby/facebook-color-scheme) together with the Material Theme UI, I'll release a [Facebook Theme](https://github.com/ChrisRM/facebook-theme-jetbrains) when this is free of any significant bugs. Stay tuned :)

#### Disclaimer
I am no Java-developer, and to be honest I have no intention to become one. My preferred language is PHP, but I managed to 
hack this together using available resources and general programming knowledge. Do not expect Java Best Practices here. :-) 

If you decide to improve the code/structure of this plugin, please send me a pull request.


**Thanks to [@equinusocio](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) for making this awesome theme.**
