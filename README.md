# JetBrains Material Theme
This is a [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) port of both the UI and UX for JetBrains products.

I want to add a couple more icons, try to remove or prettify the separators and clean up the code before I release the source, but for those being a little impatient, here's the builds ;-)

**NOTE**: Make sure you backup the .jar's you are replacing. This is for PhpStorm only. Other applications will be supported later.

[php.jar](http://cdn.hifive.no/material-ui/php.jar) 
Required to replace the php file-icon.

**Installation**: Replace `/Applications/PhpStorm/Contents/plugins/php/lib/php.jar`

[phpstorm.jar](http://cdn.hifive.no/material-ui/phpstorm.jar)
UI Colors

**Installation**: Replace `/Applications/PhpStorm/Contents/lib/phpstorm.jar`

[Material Theme.jar](http://cdn.hifive.no/material-ui/Material%20Theme.jar)
Replaces all icons and sets the sidebar/tree background to the same as your editor background.

**Installation**: In PhpStorm go to `PhpStorm` - `Preferences` - `Plugins` - `Install plugin from disk` - `Select Material Theme.jar and restart`

[Material Theme.icls](http://cdn.hifive.no/material-ui/Material%20Theme.icls)
Colour scheme. 

**Installation**: Add it to `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde90/colors/Material Theme.icls` and select it from the preferences. You might need to restart PhpStorm after adding the file.

Yeah, it's alot, but I'll create an installer for all this later. Let me know how it goes!
